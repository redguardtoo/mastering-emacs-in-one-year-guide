* Master Emacs in One Year
** English version
Guide on how to master Emacs in one year.

The critical question is whether one year is enough.

My answer is a big YES, if you know how to do it efficiently!

Here are the tips *for your first year*:
- Set the standard to the highest
- DON'T create your own setup
- Report bugs to the master
- DON'T learn Lisp
- DON'T remember key bindings

Emacs Lisp has nothing to do with your IQ. So don't feel pressured to master it asap. As I observed, most people (including me) dislike language with unfamiliar syntax. That's ok. Start from using Emacs, you will feel the love for Emacs, then comes the love for Lisp naturally.

Web版本也会发布在我的[[http://blog.csdn.net/redguardtoo/article/details/7222501][CSDN博客]]和[[http://blog.binchen.org/?p=268][个人博客]].

我建议一年内,
- 标准要最高
- 不要从头创建自己的配置
- 给高手报告bug
- 不要学习Lisp
- 不要记快捷键

Lisp和你的IQ毫无关系.不要急着学它.据我观察,大多数人(包括我)讨厌语法怪异的语言.这很正常,先从使用软件开始,当你爱上Emacs,对Lisp的爱也就跟着来了.
