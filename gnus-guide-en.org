** Introduction
Gnus is a nice email client.

But many newbies get lost in its features. It would be much easier if they learned the *essential 5% features* and ignore the remaining 95% at the beginning.

So here is my guide on the 5%.

** Why (OPTIONAL)
- Gnus is *solid*
- Works on all platforms
- Less hardware resource required
- Mail search and filter is great
- Bundled with Emacs, no extra installation needed
- Usable when offline. Check the "offline" part in the section "Advanced tips"
- powerful combined with other plugins like [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][yasnippet]]

** Quick start
*** Requirements and conventions
A little homework is needed before we start,
- This guide applies on Emacs24+
- You need install GnuTLS and OpenSSH on Linux/Mac/Window(Cygwin)
- =C= means =Ctrl= and =M= means =Alt=. For example, =M-x= means pressing =Alt= and =x= together.
- =M-x mycommand= means pressing =Alt= and =x=, input "mycommand", and press =Enter= key.
- =RET= means =Enter= key.
- "Group" means "mail folder".
- "Group buffer" means the list of folders.
- "Summary buffer" means the list of mails.

*** Sample setup
Now please check [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusGmail]] for basics. You can also use my settings at the end of this article.

*** Usage
After setup, =M-x gnus= in Emacs.

You will come to the "Group Buffer" window. The "Group Buffer" lists the mail folders. In Gnus, the folder is called "Group". By default, the folders are *invisible*!

Please subscribe the groups to make it visible. For example, INBOX is named "nnimap+gmail:INBOX" in "Group Buffer" and *it's invisible at the beginning*!. I admit it's confusing.

Check section "Subscribe groups" for details.

At minimum, you need subcribe INBOX group. But after subscribing the INBOX is still *invisible* if INBOX contains NO unread mails. Yes, I agree with you this makes no sense for a modern email client!

You can =C-u 5 M-x gnus-group-list-all-groups= to solve this problem.

You can insert below code into ~/.emacs to create hotkey =o= for =C-u 5 M-x gnus-group-list-all-groups= :
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun my-gnus-group-list-subscribed-groups ()
  "List all subscribed groups with or without un-read messages"
  (interactive)
  (gnus-group-list-all-groups 5))

(define-key gnus-group-mode-map
  ;; list all the subscribed groups even they contain zero un-read messages
  (kbd "o") 'my-gnus-group-list-subscribed-groups)
#+END_SRC

In the "Group Buffer", you can enter a folder by pressing =RET=. But I strongly suggest =C-u RET= because you intend to see all the mails instead of unread mails.

In the folder, you are viewing "Summary Buffer" which is, as I said before, the list of your mails.

Now it's simple. Press =RET= to see the mail. Press =q= to quit "Summary Buffer".

In short, "Group Buffer" lists mail folders. "Summary Buffer" lists mails in one folder.

That's all you need to know. You could go to section [[My Gnus configuration (for Gmail)]] to use Gnus now without reading remaining sections.
** Essential 5%
Don't memorize all the key bindings. Only pick up what you actually use.

At the end of this article, I provide *my [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] setup to help you avoid remembering key bindings *.

Please check section "Use Hydra to avoid remembering key bindings".
*** Search mails
**** Search mails on Server
Press =G G= or =M-x gnus-group-make-nnir-group= to search mails at *server side* in "Group Buffer".

You can press =#= to mark the groups.  Search will be limited to marked groups. =M-#= to unmark.

If no group marked, the group under cursor is searched.

Place the cursor before the first group, all groups will be searched.

To search certain fields in the mail, press =C-u G G= or =C-u M-x gnus-group-make-nnir-group= instead. This is a very useful technique.

You can apply [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-6.4.4][more advanced search syntax]] by:
- Press =C-u G G= or =C-u M-x gnus-group-make-nnir-group=
- Input query statements, press Enter
- Type "imap", press Enter

**** Filter mails locally
Press =/ /= to limit the mails by subject at "Summary Buffer". "Limiting" means *filtering mails locally*.

Press =/ a= to limit the mails by author at "Summary Buffer".

=/ w= to cancel the current filter.

You can apply the limits sequentially and cancel them in reverse order by pressing =/ w=.

"Limiting" is cool. [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/gnus.html#Limiting]] has more tricks.

See [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2008/05/emacs-gnus-searching-mail/]] for technical details.

*** Subscribe groups
Press =A A= or =M-x gnus-group-list-active= in "Group Buffer" to fetch groups list on *all connected server*. It take a while. I suggest pressing "L" to use local cache instead after =A A= once.

After =A A= or =L=, press =u= to subscribe/unsubscribe specific group.

In order to see all the mails in "INBOX" folder/group, you need *MANUALLY* subscribe the group "INBOX"!

Pressing =o= is *much better*. It is the hotkey I created for =C-u 5 M-x gnus-group-list-all-groups=, as mentioned in previous sections.

Press =g= or =M-x gnus-group-get-new-news= to refresh groups list.

You can also subscribe programmatically in ~/.gnus.el:
#+begin_src elisp
(gnus-subscribe-hierarchically "nnimap+hotmail:Inbox")
#+end_src
*** Reply email
Press =R= or =M-x gnus-summary-reply-with-original= to reply with quoted text. Press =r= or =M-x gnus-summary-reply= to reply without quoted text.

Press =S W= (captalized S then captalized W) or =M-x gnus-summary-wide-reply-with-original=to reply all with quoted text. It's called "wide reply" in Emacs.

Press =S w= or =M-x gnus-summary-wide-reply= to reply all without quoted text.
*** Compose new email
Press =m= or =M-x gnus-new-mail= in "Summary Buffer".

You could also =C-x m= or =M-x componse-mail= anywhere in Emacs without bugging Gnus.
*** Re-send as new mail
Press =S D e= or =M-x gnus-summary-resend-message-edit=. Useful if you re-send mail in Draft folder.
*** Attach a file
Press =C-c C-a= or =M-x mml-attach-file=.

The attached file is actually plain text embedded in mail body. You can copy and modify the text.
*** Save attachment
Move *focus over the attachment* and press =o= or =M-x gnus-mime-save-part=. See "[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Using-MIME.html][Using Mime]]" in Emacs manual for details.
*** Open attachment
Move *focus over the attachment* and press =Enter= or =M-x gnus-article-press-button=.

The flag =[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs-mime/mailcap.html][mailcap-mime-data]]= controls what program is used to open the attachment.

You can change the flag directly at Window or OSX.

At Linux, use =M-x mailcap-parse-mailcaps= to load data from ~/.mailcap into =mailcap-mime-data=.

My ~/.mailcap:
#+begin_src conf
# url
text/html; w3m -I %{charset} -T text/html; copiousoutput;

# image viewer
image/*; feh -F -d -S filename '%s';

# pdf
application/pdf; zathura '%s';
image/pdf; zathura '%s'

# video
video/* ; mplayer '%s'
audio/* ; mplayer '%s'

# Office files.
application/msword; soffice '%s'
application/rtf; soffice '%s'
text/richtext; soffice '%s'
application/vnd.ms-excel; soffice '%s'
application/vnd.ms-powerpoint; soffice '%s'
#+end_src

*** Send email
Press =C-c C-c= or =M-x message-send-and-exit=.
*** Refresh "Summary Buffer" (check new mails)
hotkey =/ N= or =M-x gnus-summary-insert-new-articles=.
*** Make all mails visible (IMPORTANT)
Press =C-u RET= on the selected group in "Group Buffer", or =C-u M-g= in "Summary Buffer".

That's the *most important part* of this article! By default, Gnus only displays unread mails.

Check [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4982831/i-dont-want-to-expire-mail-in-gnus]] for details.
*** Forward mail
Press =C-c C-f= or =M-x gnus-summary-mail-forward= in "Summary Buffer".

You can mark multiple mails to forward (hotkey is "#") and forward them in one mail. [[https://plus.google.com/112423173565156165016/posts][Holger Schauer]] provided the tip.

After the forwarded email is created, you may copy the body of that email without sending it. The copied content could be inserted into new mail.
*** Mark mails as read
Press =c= either in "Summary Buffer" or "Group Buffer". This is *my most frequently used command* because it's easier Gmail's own UI!
*** Tree view of mail folders
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Group-Topics.html][Group Topics]] is used re-organize the mail folder into tree view.

For example, you can place mail folders from Gmail into "gmail" topic, mails from Outlook.com into "hotmail" topic, place "gmail" and "hotmail" under root topic "Gnus".

The setup is only one line,
#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'gnus-group-mode-hook 'gnus-topic-mode)
#+end_src

Though you can read [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Topic-Commands.html][offical manual]] to learn its command, my way is much better.

Insert below code into ~/.gnus.el and you are done,
#+begin_src elisp
(eval-after-load 'gnus-topic
  '(progn
     (setq gnus-message-archive-group '((format-time-string "sent.%Y")))
     (setq gnus-topic-topology '(("Gnus" visible)
                                 (("misc" visible))
                                 (("hotmail" visible nil nil))
                                 (("gmail" visible nil nil))))

     (setq gnus-topic-alist '(("hotmail" ; the key of topic
                               "nnimap+hotmail:Inbox"
                               "nnimap+hotmail:Drafts"
                               "nnimap+hotmail:Sent")
                              ("gmail" ; the key of topic
                               "INBOX"
                               "[Gmail]/Sent Mail"
                               "Drafts")
                              ("misc" ; the key of topic
                               "nnfolder+archive:sent.2015-12"
                               "nnfolder+archive:sent.2016"
                               "nndraft:drafts")
                              ("Gnus")))))
#+end_src

Instead remembering topic commands, editing about snippet is more straightforward. The only requirement is a little bit of Emacs Lisp knowledge.

The flag =gnus-message-archive-group= defines archive folder of sent mail. By default new folder is created *monthly*. My setup make it created *yearly*.
** Advanced tips
*** Windows?
It's *100% usable* if you install [[https://www.cygwin.com/][Cygwin]] at first.

Gnus from Cygwin version of Emacs works out of the box.

Native [[https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/][Emacs for Windows]] need a little setup:
- Right-click "My Computer" and go to "Properties -> Advanced -> Environmental Variables"
- Setup *user variables* which does not require Administrator right
- Set the variable "HOME" to the parent directory of your ".emacs.d" directory
- Set the variable "PATH" to the "C:\cygwin64\bin". I supposed you install cygwin at C driver
- Install GnuTLS and OpenSSH through Cygwin's package manager
*** Outlook?
Exchange/Outlook users could read my post [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/how-to-get-email-from-exchange-server-without-outlook.html]].

Basically you need one portable java program [[http://davmail.sourceforge.net/][Davmail]]. That's enough in 99% companies. But if your Adminstrator is evil, you need use [[http://ewseditor.codeplex.com/][EWSEditor]] for once.
*** Auto-complete mail address
Install [[http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/][BBDB]]  through [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/bbdb][melpa]]. It is a email address database written in Emacs Lisp.

Insert below code into ~/.emacs,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
             (bbdb-initialize 'message)
             (bbdb-initialize 'gnus)
             (local-set-key "<TAB>" 'bbdb-complete-name)))
#+END_SRC

[[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]] does the similar job which works out of the box.

I use both =M-x bbdb-complete-name= because company-mode is a little picky on BBDB versions.
*** Synchronize from Gmail contacts
Please,
- Go to [[https://www.google.com/contacts/]]
- Click "More -> Export -> vCard Format -> Export".
- Install [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/gmail2bbdb]] (developed by me) and press =M-x gmail2bbdb-import-file=. The contacts will be output into ~/.bbdb which is automatically detected by Emacs

There are alternatives which requires certain version of BBDB. My plugin doesn't have this issue.
*** Customize "From" field
Easiest solution is switch the FROM field dynamically by =M-x toggle-mail-from-field=:
#+begin_src elisp
(defun toggle-mail-from-field ()
  (interactive)
  (cond
   ((string= "personal@gmail.com" user-mail-address)
    (setq user-mail-address "myname@office.com"))
   (t
    (setq user-mail-address "personal@gmail.com")))
  (message "Mail FROM: %s" user-mail-address))
#+end_src

A more complex solution is setup FROM field by the computer you are using:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (getenv "HOSTNAME") won't work because $HOSTNAME is not an env variable
;; (system-name) won't work because my /etc/hosts has some weird setup in office
(setq my-hostname (with-temp-buffer
        (shell-command "hostname" t)
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (delete-char -1)
        (buffer-string)))

(defun at-office ()
  (interactive)
  (and (string= my-hostname "my-sydney-workpc")
       (not (or (string= my-hostname "homepc")
                (string= my-hostname "eee")))))

(setq user-full-name "My Name"
      user-mail-address (if (at-office) "me@mycompany.com" "me@gmail.com"))
#+END_SRC

Please note,
- Command line program =hostname= is better than Emacs function =(system-name)=
- I works on several computers which does *not* belong to me, so I cannot change /etc/hosts which =(system-name)= try to access
- Please [[http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=22370][verify]] your email address at Gmail if you use google's SMTP server

*** Classify email
[[http://getpopfile.org/][Popfile]].

You may think [[http://www.google.com/inbox/][Google's Inbox]] equals to Popfile. Trust me, it's not. You only need Popfile!

Popfile is open sourced. The data is stored *locally* with my full control. For example, the algorithm trained by Gmail can be used to classify mails from Microsoft Exchange Mail Server.

Check [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/use-popfile-at-linux.html]] for details.
*** Write HTML mail
Use [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-mime.html][org-mime]].

Usage is simple. Write mail in org format and =M-x org-mime-htmlize=.

Please use my patched [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/][org-mime]] which supports Emacs 24.
*** Read HTML mail
Install [[http://w3m.sourceforge.net/][w3m]] and [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-w3m][emacs-w3m]].

Then insert below code into ~/.emacs,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq mm-text-html-renderer 'w3m)
#+END_SRC
*** Read mail offline
Go to the "Summary Buffer".

You need mark the mails by press =!= or =M-x gnus-summary-tick-article-forward=.

The marked mails enter the disk cache. They can be read offline.

You may remove it from the disk cache by =M-x gnus-summary-put-mark-as-read=.

You also need insert below code into ~/.emacs,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq gnus-use-cache t)
#+END_SRC
Above code set =gnus-use-cache= to true to use the cache to the full extent by "wasting" *tens of megabytes* disk space.

The disk cache is located at "~/News/cache/". You can back it up with Github's private repository.
*** Multiple accounts
You only need copy the code containing "gnus-secondary-select-methods" from my setup.

Here is a sample setup,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'gnus-secondary-select-methods
             '(nnimap "gmail-second"
                      (nnimap-address "imap.gmail.com")
                      (nnimap-server-port 993)
                      (nnimap-stream ssl)
                      (nnir-search-engine imap)
                      ; @see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Expiring-Mail.html
                      ;; press 'E' to expire email
                      (nnmail-expiry-target "nnimap+gmail:[Gmail]/Trash")
                      (nnmail-expiry-wait 90)))
#+END_SRC

=gnus-secondary-select-methods= is the list of your email accounts.

The information of multiple accounts is stored at ~/.authinfo.gpg.
*** Why Gnus displays more mails than Gmail
Gnus counts by individual mail. Gmail count by mail thread.
*** Subscribe "[Gmail]/Sent Mail" folder
So Gnus can track *all sent mails*.
*** Reconnect mail server
Press =M-x gnus-group-enter-server-mode= to go into server list.

Move the cursor to "offline" server then press =M-x gnus-server-open-server=.
*** Use Hydra to avoid remembering key bindings
- Install [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] through [[http://melpa.org/]]
- Insert below code into ~/.emacs. Then press =C-c C-y= when composing mail. Press =y= in other modes

#+begin_src elisp

** My setup
